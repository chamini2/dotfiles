# my magic photobooth symlink -> dropbox. I love it.
# first move Photo Booth folder out of Pictures
# then start Photo Booth. It'll ask where to put the library.
# put it in Dropbox/public
# now you can record photobooth videos quickly and they upload to dropbox DURING RECORDING
# then you grab public URL and send off your video message in a heartbeat.

# Check gems are up to date without installing documentation
#sudo gem update --system --no-document

# Set symlink for Sublime Text 2
#ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
